# Multiplication-using-booth-add-shift-methods
In this program, an attempt has been made to write code that takes a file named in.txt containing certain values and, based on the input, performs one of the types of multiplication on the input numbers.

First line: The number n, which represents the number of input batches (maximum of 10).
n input batches
Each input batch includes the following:
The number m, which indicates the type of multiplication algorithm (0 for shift&add and 1 for Booth's algorithm).
The number b, which indicates the bit length of the numbers to be multiplied (maximum of 32).
The number s, which indicates whether the numbers are signed or unsigned (0 for positive and 1 for mixedsigned and 2 for both negative ).
The numbers A and B, which are to be multiplied (in base 10).
